    <h3>Crepes Yum Yum</h3>
    <p>Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes.</p>
    <p>It's made from ingredients that everyone has
    on hand.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter melte</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine.
        Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using
        approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other
        side. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
